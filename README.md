# Personal / Portfolio Website - [a link]diegojflores.com

## Description:

My personal website, which also acts as my portfolio site, was built with Ruby on Rails and is hosted on Heroku and Google Pages. It contains an About Me section, displays my Projects, shows my most recent blog posts on Medium, and allows visitors to email me using ActionMailer and SendGrid.

## Built With:

* Ruby 2.3.3p222
* Rails 5.1.5
* Heroku
* SendGrid
* CSS3

## Note:

I built this website during the month of April and May 2018. However, due to security issues, I had to delete the original repository holding the project. I continued to work on the project on my local machine, and pushed it to a new repo once the security issues were taken care of. This is why the first commit just shows a push of all the code onto the repo.
